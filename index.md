# Call for papers
Due to the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, 
the 14<sup>th</sup> edition of the international conference 
**ArcheoFOSS Open Software, hardware, processes, data and formats in archaeological research** 
will be held online on **October, 15<sup>th</sup> - 17<sup>th</sup> 2020**.

The Conference will address a range of important topics and themes relating to data sharing, open tools, processes and formats in the archaeological domain.

We are inviting scholars, independent researchers, institutions, freelance archaeologists and professional companies involved in Cultural Heritage to submit original research or case studies by exposing the latest trends, theoretical or practical developments and challenges in the field. The Organising Committee strongly encourages abstract proposals focused on the following three thematic areas.


### ![icon](./images/icons/trowel.svg "Trowel") Theme 1. Use and Application of Free/Libre and Open Source (FLOS) Tools in Archaeology 

The session covers all the aspects connected with the application of free/libre and open source tools, such as software and hardware solutions, as well as processes, in the archaeological scope.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
- projects and research with workflows based on the FLOS paradigm;
- methods and strategies for using FLOS in archaeology;
- management of excavation data, photographic and graphic documentation;
- 3D survey, data processing and 3D reconstructions;
- data analysis through deep learning techniques (images, point clouds, etc);
- scientific transparency;
- innovative data publishing strategies;
- integration, through open formats, with non-archaeological workflows (geology, engineering, construction science, environmental analysis, etc).


### ![icon](./images/icons/share.svg "Share") Theme 2. Creation, use and Promotion of Open Data and Open Formats in Archaeology

The session encompasses themes such as the creation, publication and sharing of Open Data in archaeology, including commercial software. Particular attention will be given to the development and promotion of Open Formats. 

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
- projects and research with open format outcomes;
- publication strategies based on Open Data and Linked Open Data (LOD);
- adoption of transparent and documented data transformation processes;
- processing, retrieving and re-publication of legacy data;
- long term archiving and storage strategies for Cultural Heritage data through open formats.

### ![icon](./images/icons/gears.svg "Gears") Theme 3. Development and Customization of FLOS Software and Hardware Solutions for Cultural Heritage 

The session hosts papers dedicated to the development and customization of free/libre and open source tools, with a special focus on software and hardware components and their effect on data, formats and processes.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
- creation of hardware/software tools for data modeling and integration;
- creation of hardware/software solutions for data collection in the field of Cultural Heritage;
- development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning solutions;
- open hardware framework for data management;
- development of software/hardware Internet of Things (IoT) tools for Cultural Heritage.

## Abstract Submission
The abstracts (4000 characters max.), together with prospective images (max. 5), 
captions and a short biography of the author/authors, must be submitted

opting for multi-platform environments. Furthermore, the workshop should be accessible 
through Linux (most popular distributions), Windows and MacOS systems;
- Applicants will have to provide a compatible working environment (software, libraries, 
data) or provide in advance detailed instructions to set it properly. Applicants should 
remain available to the registered participants, before the beginning of the workshop, in 
order to solve any problems in the working environment. The organisation of a follow-up 
session (4-5 weeks after the workshop work), with the support of the organizing committee, 
is highly encouraged.
- Applicants and participants must agree with the video recording of the workshop 
and its publication through ArcheoFOSS communication channels;
- Applicants are required to provide teaching material to the ArcheoFOSS organizing 
committee, who may publish the material on its website and/or in its public repositories..

## Workshop proposal submission
The proposal (3000 characters max.), which shall include a detailed description 
of the practical purposes of the workshop and detailed information on required
hardware/software configuration, must be submitted through this link: 
[https://forms.gle/TCPNg7NNC3UvnFiEA](https://forms.gle/TCPNg7NNC3UvnFiEA) by <strike>30/06/2020</strike>**12/07/2020**.
